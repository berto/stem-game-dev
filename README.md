# STEM Game Development Workshop

Teach the power of programming and unveil the magic behind game development. 

## Introduction

Computers can do all sorts of amazing things and we think of them as being super smart, but did you know that a computer really can't do anything unless you tell it how?

What are some things that computers can do?

Game development!!

## Objectives

By the end of the lesson, students should:
  * Understand that computers cannot "read between the line" like humans do and instead need more thorough, literal instruction
  * Understand what is involved in communicating to a computer
  * Be able to modify a game using programming code

## Format
  * 10 mins - We'll do an introduction and a hook: we'll ask them to tell us how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and we act out exactly what they tell us (it's great, they always make assumptions).
  * 20 mins - We'll show some slides talking about how we communicate to computers through game development
  * 10 mins - We'll introduce an exercise to alter a game to make it easier for our users (no code)
  * 30 mins - Workshop. We walk around and help them.
  * 20 mins - We group up again and showcase the changes.
  * 10 mins - Conclusion and takeaways

## Demo

- Display the demo game. 
- Show and break down the code. 
- Highlight key components like sprites, actions, and gravity.
- Change some of the numbers (gravity, character speed, etc.)

## Workshop

- Set the scene: you are part of a game development company. Your users are complaining that the game is too difficult and they would like the game to have cheats.
- Showcase flappy bird and tanks. Have students come up and play. Highlight the difficulty of the game.
- Set task for the games
- Flappy Bird: you want it to be easier to get 100 points
- Tanks: you want it to be faster to defeat the enemies
- Seperate into groups by game
- Have the students pick a game and brainstorm for 10 minutes on what they could change about the game to make each of the cases happen
- With a facilitator, have the students take turns implementing the changes and watching what happens
